    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>In this section we should describe the rationale behind creating the new component. We could include things such as: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What we've already tested with users</li>
      <li>Why any alternative existing designs did not work for our users</li>
      <li>What problems we think this design will alleviate</li>
      <li>Any similar designs that influenced our approach</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We should use the rationale section to explain our thought processes, to give any visitors to this page some context behind our approach.</p>
    <p>By providing context, we can help build understanding of what we want to achieve and hopefully encourage others to collaborate with us.</p>
    <p>Be as descriptive as possible!</p>

    <h2>Where was this design used?</h2>
    <p>In this section we should explain what service the design was used, or is intended to be used on.</p>
    <p>We have many different products and services both within Screening and the wider NHS, so it is important to state where the design is intended for use. This will allow other members of the community to understand both how the design applies to that product or service, but also how it could apply to similar work being done elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Explain who your users are, what they use your service for and what devices they are likely to access your service on. A good explanation here will encourage feedback and collaboration.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>In this section we should detail all of the relevant research we have relating to the component we have built.</p>
    <p>It is important to surface research findings here, even if they are also stored elsewhere. It allows us to show how robust (or not) our designs are, and gives others an understanding of why the design may or may not work in their own product or service.</p>
    <p>To do this, we need to be as detailed as possible. Use any artefact you think is suitable - quotes, survey results, affinity mapping, images - whatever it takes to drill home the findings.</p>
    <p>This section may become quite lengthy, but don't worry. Here, it's better to have too much information than not enough whilst we seek feedback and collaboration opportunities.</p>

    <h2>Variations</h2>
    <p>If you have any variations to your design then share them in this section.</p>
    <p>By variations, we mean things that expand on the core component. Think things like conditional content for a checkbox, or different types of button.</p>
