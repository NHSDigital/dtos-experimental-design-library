        About this design library
      </h2>

      <p>
        This repository will be used to enable collaboration between teams working on Screening products and services, as well as allowing us to share our work to the wider NHS community.
      </p>

      <p>It is <strong>not intended to replace</strong> the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system">NHS Digital service manual design system</a>.</p>

        You can <a href="/why-we-created-the-screening-design-system">read more</a> about why we initiated this repository, and what our aims for it are.

      <h2>
        The design library
      </h2>

      <p>Where possible, we will look to utilise existing design system styles, components and patterns to build our services.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5">Where this is not possible, we will take a user centred approach to developing new content and showcase it in this repository, which will be actively maintained and updated.</p>
