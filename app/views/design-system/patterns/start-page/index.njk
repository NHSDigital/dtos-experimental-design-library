  <h2>When to use a start page</h2>

  <p>At the start of a service which involves the user inputting information in order to get something. For example, at the start of an application form.</p>
  <p>To get a start page on the NHS website, contact the NHS website information architecture team through the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/slack">service manual public Slack workspace</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to use a start page</h2>

  </p>Start pages include 4 main elements. These are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>he service name: this helps people understand what your service does and whether they need to use it (read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service">naming your service on GOV.UK</a>)</li>
    <li>a short introduction to list things most users need to know, for example, what your service is, what will happen, what users will get or how much it’ll cost</li>
    <li>he “Start now” call-to-action button</li>
    <li>a list of other ways to access the service</li>  
  </ol>

  <p>Keep your start page focused on helping users get started and successfully complete the service.</p>

  <p>A good start page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>lets users know they’re in the right place</li>
    <li>sets expectations: users know what to expect before clicking anything, including whether they’re eligible and what the outcome will be</li>
    <li>helps users succeed by telling them what information they must give or documents they need to have</li>
    <li>gives users other options if the service is not for them, because it is connected to a wider topic</li>
    <li>Is easy to find and ranks highly in search engines, because it uses the language of its users</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Put your start page in the right place</h3>

  </p>Consider where your transaction sits in a wider topic, service or website. Do not disconnect it from its wider context. Place it in a broader information architecture with elements such as the main navigation, internal search and breadcrumbs. This helps users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>feel confident they're on the right start page</li>
    <li>know if the service is for them and that they’re eligible</li>
    <li>avoid dead ends, if they’re in the wrong place, and find what they need through surrounding navigation elements</li>
  </ul>

  </p>If the user needs more information to understand the service, consider placing the start of the transaction in a guide.</p>
  
  </p>If possible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>run an open card sort to see how users group and label pages around your start page, including the start page</li>
    <li>run tree tests to check users find the start page in your proposed structure</li>
    <li>follow up with usability testing</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Set a helpful URL</h3>

  <p>Set up a URL that embeds your start page in the wider service, topic or website. Use a verb that reflects the name of the task or service.</p>
  <p>Here is a good example:</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/hospitals/book-an-appointment/. ">https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/hospitals/book-an-appointment/</a>.</p>
  <p>It’s the URL for booking an appointment using the NHS e-Referral service. It shows the start page's relationship to the wider topic and the website it sits in: book an appointment, for hospitals that are part of NHS services.</p>
  <p>If you need to, create a short vanity URL to promote the service in letters or other offline activities which direct people to the service start page. For example, this is the vanity URL for e-Referral service bookings: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/referrals">https://www.nhs.uk/referrals</a>.</p>

  <h3>Make it easy to update your start page</h3>

  <p>We know from our experience with the NHS website that start pages need to be updated regularly, sometimes at short notice.</p>
  <p>If possible, put your start page in a content management system so it’s easy for a number of people to amend. It can be difficult to manage if you have it in a separate application and rely on a developer to make changes.</p>

  <h3>Check your start page includes the correct links</h3>

  <p>Many websites (including the NHS website) have policy and contact information links in the footer that relate to the website as a whole. These may not be the right links for your service.</p>
  <p>If your start page sits in a wider website, but your service is on an external domain, make sure users can access service-specific policy and contact information, for example by placing links on the start page.</p>

  <h3>What not to include on a start page</h3>

  <p>Avoid telling people all about the service on the start page. Too much information will distract them.</p>
  <p>Bear in mind that many users will not look at information below the start button.</p>
  <p>If you can, check eligibility as part of the service to avoid overloading the start page with criteria.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility</h2>

  <p>It is particularly important to keep your start page brief for users with access needs. Consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>how a screen reader will read out the content</li>
    <li>how much time it takes for the user to get to the main call to action</li>
    <li>how much information they have to process</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Lots of people miss information below the start button, especially people who zoom in or magnify content on the page and people with screen readers who navigate the page by headings and interactive elements (such as buttons).</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <p>This pattern is based on <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/">Start pages – GOV.UK Design System</a>, which has been tested over a number of years in a wide range of contexts.</p>

  <h3>Start now button</h3>

  <p>We follow the GOV.UK start page pattern and word the start button “Start now”.</p>
  <p>There are good reasons to use context-specific verbs, like “Book now”, “Check now” or “Start booking”, but we do not have enough research to recommend these yet. Please let us know if you have research to share.</p>

  <h3>Average time to complete</h3>

  <p>Some services have found that telling users how long it takes helps set expectations and increases the number of successful journeys.</p>
  <p>But the time it takes varies a lot, especially for users with access needs. Users who take longer than average may feel pressurised or stupid. If you’re researching this, test with a wide range of users, and let us know what you find.</p>

  <h3>Known issues and gaps</h3>

  <p>We do not yet have sufficient information about start pages within applications, such as services in the NHS app that appear after a user has signed in.</p>
  <p>We also need to know more about services where the user needs to read content as part of the journey, as well as fill in a form.</p>
