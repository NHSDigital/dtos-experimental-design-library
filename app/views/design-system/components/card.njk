  <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
  <p>Cards should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. They can contain multiple elements, such as an image, title, text and links.</p>

  <h3 id="basic-card">Basic card</h3>

  <h3 id="clickable-card">Clickable card</h3>
  <p>For cards that contain a single link, the hit area for that link can be made to wrap the entire card.</p>
  <p>We avoid wrapping an entire card in an anchor tag as this can be a difficult experience for a screen reader user.</p>

  <h3 id="card-with-an-image">Card with an image</h3>

  <p>The card image is set as a <a href="/accessibility/content#use-alternative-text-for-images-in-content">decorative image</a> by default, with the alternative text being null.</p>

  <h3 id="card-group">Card group</h3>
  <p>Multiple cards can be grouped to display a collection related topics.</p>
  <p>You should prioritise the cards so the content users most need to know comes first.</p>
  <p>We define the width of the cards using the <a href="/design-system/styles/layout#grid">grid system</a>. For example, <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-half</code> is used to make the cards half width:</p>

  <p>For thirds use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-third</code>:</p>

  <p>For quarters use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-quarter</code>:</p>

  <h3 id="heading-level-and-size">Heading level and size</h3>
  <p><a href="/accessibility/design#use-headings-correctly">Make sure your headings reflect the page structure</a> by changing the level of the heading.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of replacing the default <code>h2</code> heading with a <code>h3</code>:</p>

  <p>You can change the size of the heading using <a href="/design-system/styles/typography#headings">heading typography styles</a>.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of using a <code>h2</code> with a <code>nhsuk-heading-s</code> class to reduce the size of the heading:</p>
