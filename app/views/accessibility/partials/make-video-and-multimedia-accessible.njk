<p>Consider using video as well as text. Some people find it easier to understand.</p>
<p>With all video and multimedia, make sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the interface is accessible for keyboard and screen reader users (including play/pause buttons and the location slider)</li>
  <li>if the user cannot see or hear it, they can still understand it</li>
</ul>
<p>New videos uploaded after 23 September 2020 must include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>captions</li>
  <li>a transcript</li>
  <li>an audio description</li>
</ul>

      Captions

  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>People who are Deaf or hard of hearing and cannot hear some of the content will need captions. Captions are a text form of audio information in video and animations.</p>
    <p>Include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the words people say</li>
      <li>who is speaking, if it is not obvious, or where they are (for example, off-screen)</li>
      <li>important sounds like music or laughter or a door slamming</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Synchronise captions with the visual content.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>Transcripts provide audio and video content for people who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are both Deaf and blind
      <li>people who process text information better than audio and visual information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A transcript should include all the dialogue, relevant sound effects, and audio description content.</p>
    <p>If the video relies on visual content to convey information (for example, diagrams without a verbal description), it's best to include an audio description.</p>

      Audio description

  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>Audio description provides content for people who are blind or cannot see the video well. It is additional commentary that describes what's happening on screen in between narration, including any text, graphics or scene changes in the video.</p>
    <p>You can do 1 of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>publish an alternative version of the video and add audio description narration to the main audio track</li>
      <li>add a separate audio track (if the media player supports this)</li>
    </ul>
