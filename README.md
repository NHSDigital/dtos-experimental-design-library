### Creating a tagged released

Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual/releases) and [draft a new release](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual/releases/new).
The tag version should be the version in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [package.json](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual/blob/master/package.json#L3) files, prefixed with a `v`. For example `v13.15.1`. The release title should be the same.
The release description should be the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual/blob/master/package.json#L3) entry for this version's release. You can find examples of other release descriptions on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual/releases).
Then click the Publish release button. 
After a couple of minutes the pipelines will complete and the release will start.
